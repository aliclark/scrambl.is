	  <h2>About</h2>
	  <p>Scrambl.is protects your communications by turning them
	  into seemingly random encoded messages that can be read
	  using only a secret passphrase.</p>
	  <p>Each passphrase has its own 45 character identifier, or
	  public key, to which messages can be encoded. Public keys
	  can be shared freely with anyone who may want to send you a
	  private message. Keys are normally shared as clickable links
	  for convenience.</p>
	  <p>It's important that you keep hold of the passphrase, so you
	  can leave the web page and still use it later to read your old
	  messages. Common methods of doing this are by
	  learning it over time, writing it down and keeping it in a
	  very safe place such as your wallet, or using a password
	  manager application.</p>
	  <p>Passphrases are always generated locally and never
	  uploaded to a server, so messages encoded to a public key
	  are entirely private to the sender and receiver.</p>
	  <p>The software is fully open source
	  (<a href="https://github.com/aliclark/scrambl.is">found
	  here</a>), which means anyone can review and contribute
	  improvements to it. The scrambl.is website is maintained by
	  Ali Clark, the original developer, but does nothing
	  other than serve these webpages.</p>
	  <p>It's possible to use the scrambl.is home page offline by
	  saving it with Right Click, Save Page As, and then double
	  clicking on the index.html page that was saved, but for most
	  it will be easier to revisit the website each time.</p>
